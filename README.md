# gdoc


Build a Google Doc tool for meetings with people who are working for me (nelsonelijah.com/meet). Entrance is locked till I allow you. Then, you can create your own session w/ me to document your progress and tasks. I can then view everyone from my side. And it automatically queues tasks (+priority). I want to build a Google Docs where each side tab can be locked and only accessible by one person (react gui, nodejs, typescript, drag and drop, animations d3.js, p.js, Electron)
